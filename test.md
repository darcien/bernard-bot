Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.

Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.

You don't believe in the Force, do you? He is here. Ye-ha! All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it? I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.

Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here.

I call it luck. Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight?

Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money. I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself.

Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself. Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.

What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more likeâ€¦suicide. Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.
