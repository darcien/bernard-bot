# Bernard

## What is this?

A collection of [Discord Slash command](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000368501-Slash-Commands-FAQ) handler created using [Deno](https://deno.land/)

## Does this provides any useful commands?

It depends, but generally no.

## Why?

Because I can.

## Who is this Bernard?

It is my friend from my office.
I never saw him, but nobody has ever proved he doesn't exist either.

I believe he will show himself when we're in a real pinch, one day.

## How this works?

There are 2 parts:

1. [Registering the commands](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#registering-a-command) supported by bot to Discord so people can use the registered commands from their Discord client.
2. [Responding to the HTTP request from Discord](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/receiving-and-responding) when a user executes the registered commands.
